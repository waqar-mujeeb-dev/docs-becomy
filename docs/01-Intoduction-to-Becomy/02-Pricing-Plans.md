## Free trial

Try Becomy for free with our [free trial! <Icon icon="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square" />](https://becomystaging.com/) Your trial begins when you [sign up <Icon icon="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square" />](https://becomystaging.com/admin_users/sign_up), not when you start building your store. During the trial, your store has a password or inactive checkout. To sell, remove the password or activate checkout with a paid plan. Your work is saved if you upgrade. No charges until the trial ends with a paid plan. Note: app charges are added later. Set up your store in the trial, but choose a monthly plan to start selling. If no plan is picked, your store pauses until you choose one. No need to cancel if you don't choose a plan – it stays on hold. If you choose a plan, manually pause or deactivate to cancel. Start your easy ecommerce journey with Becomy's risk-free trial now!
