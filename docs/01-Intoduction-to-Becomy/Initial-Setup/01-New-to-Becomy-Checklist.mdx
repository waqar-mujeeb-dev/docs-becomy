## New to becomy checklist

Before diving into the **Becomy** setup, it's important to clarify your objectives. Ask yourself questions like, do you plan to sell online only or also in physical locations? Are you considering selling through social platforms such as `Facebook` or `Instagram` ? Having a clear vision can speed up your setup process. Also, consider which `Becomy pricing plan` suits your needs best. You don’t need to commit to a plan until your trial period ends.

- Seek local business advice for `taxes` and `legal` regulations.
- Choose your preferred sales channels, whether it’s online, in-store, or social media.
- Think about which **Becomy pricing plan** works best for your business needs.

## Setting Up Your Becomy Store

Once your goals are in place, it's time to stock your **Becomy store** and enter your business details. Start by establishing your store’s basic configurations for products and transactions. You'll also need to set up a domain so customers can find your store online.

- Sign up and then Log into your store.
- Add `billing information` for your **Becomy account**.
- Choose the default `currency` for your store.
- Configure your `shipping` options.
- Set up local pickup or delivery (if applicable).
- Set up `taxes`.
- Configure your payment gateways for `credit cards`, `Apple Pay`, and `PayPal`.
- Add staff, if necessary.
- Set up your domain to ensure customers can easily find your store.

## Organize Your Becomy Store

The **aesthetics** of your store and the types of **products** you're going to sell are two of the most `crucial` aspects of your **Becomy store**. Experiment with different **themes** to see which one aligns best with your brand, and then start `adding products` to sell. Depending on how many products you plan to offer, adding and organizing product listings might be the most time-consuming part of setting up your Becomy store. Make sure you allocate enough time to add your products, organize them into `collections`, and configure the necessary `tax `and `shipping` information.

- **Choose a theme** that enhances your store’s `appearance.`
- **Customize your theme** to match your `brand's` identity.
- **Add your products** to the store.
- **Organize your products into collections** for better `navigation.`
- **Customize your menu and navigation** to make it easy for customers to `browse.`
- **Add a blog** to engage with your customers and share updates.

## Test Your Becomy Store

Before you officially launch your Becomy store, it’s important to conduct some `test` transactions to ensure the `checkout experience` works smoothly.

- **Conduct tests for both successful and failed transactions** to understand how your system handles different scenarios.
- **Test the process of refunding and canceling orders** to familiarize yourself with the necessary steps.
- **Evaluate order fulfillment**, including both full and partial fulfillment, to ensure you can manage inventory effectively.
- **Test archiving successful orders** to keep your order management organized.
- **Familiarize yourself with Becomy’s fraud detection settings** to protect your store from potential risks.

## Launch Your Becomy Store

Once you’ve chosen a `pricing plan` and completed your `testing`, it’s time to unveil your store to the public. You can remove the password protection on your online store, allowing customers to access it freely. Additionally, consider adding a chat widget to facilitate customer inquiries and enhance engagement.

- **Remove the password** to grant customer access to your store.
