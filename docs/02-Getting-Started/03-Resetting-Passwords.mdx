If you forget your login password or want to enhance your account's security, you can easily reset it. As the store owner, you can reset your own password and also initiate password resets for your staff members.

The process for resetting a password remains the same, even with two-step authentication enabled.

### Reset Your Forgotten Password

1. From the Becomy login page, click on `forgot password`.
