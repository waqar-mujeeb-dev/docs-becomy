Alright, so you've already set up your account â€“ high five! Now, whenever you want to dive back into your Becomy world, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser and head to [Becomy](https://MyShop.becomystaging.com).
2. Before clicking "Log In," remember to add your unique store name as a prefix to the URL. For example, if your store name is "MyShop," your login URL would be ``https://MyShop.becomystaging.com``.
3. Look for the "Log In" button, usually at the top right corner of the page.
4. Type in the email address you used during signup.
5. Remember that password you chose during signup? Time to put it to work.
6. Click the "Log In" button, and you're back in action!
7.  If you ever draw a blank on your password, no worries. Just hit the "Forgot Password" link, and we'll guide you through a quick reset.
