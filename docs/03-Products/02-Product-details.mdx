## Guide to Product Details

You can easily manage your products and help customers find what they're looking for by sharing information about them that directly affects how they appear to them. You do not have to provide every detail about your product.
To create a product, you must provide the necessary information such as the title, description, and submit product photos. You mustÂ include information that makes your product easier for your customers to understand. Add the price, any variations, weight, and shipping information.  
To update photos for product variants, navigate to the variant section of the product page. After creating the product, go to the relevant product page in the product list and update the variant images. 
This allows for easy customization and management of variant images, ensuring each variant has a distinct visual representation.
