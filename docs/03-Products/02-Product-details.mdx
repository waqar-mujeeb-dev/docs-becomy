## Guide to Product Details

The information you share about your products directly impacts how they appear to your customers, making it easy for you to manage your products, 
and assiting the customers to find the desired product. You don't have to give every detail of your product.
To create a product you need to specify the relevant details such as title, description and upload product images. Additionally, you can add details that help your clients to
easily understand product. Add Price, Variants if any, weight and shipping details.  
To update images for product variants, go to the variant section on the product page. After creating the product, navigate to the specific product page from the product list and update the variant images there. 
This allows for easy customization and management of variant images, ensuring each variant has a distinct visual representation.
