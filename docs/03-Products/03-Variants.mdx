Product variants refer to the different versions or options available for a particular product.
These variants can include various attributes such as size, color, style, material, or any other characteristic
that can be customized or chosen by the customer. For example, in apparel, a t-shirt may have variants such as different
sizes (small, medium, large) and colors (black, white, blue).

Variants are helpful in many ways for both businesses and customers. Firstly, they allow businesses to assign different
images for each set of options a product has. This helps customers to visualize the different variations of the product,
making it easier for them to make a choice.

Secondly, variants enable businesses to adjust prices depending on the options selected. For instance, a larger size or a
premium material may have a higher price compared to smaller sizes or standard materials. This flexibility in pricing caters
to different customer preferences and budgets.

Lastly, variants help businesses track inventory for each variant separately. By assigning unique SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) to each variant,
businesses can monitor the available quantity of each option. This helps prevent overselling and ensures that customers can purchase the desired
variant without encountering stock shortages.

In summary, product variants offer customers a range of choices, enable businesses to customize pricing and visuals, and streamline
inventory management to provide a smoother shopping experience for all involved.


## Add Product Variants

You can add variants for a product having more than one option, such as color, size or material.

three sizes of Green variants at one time.

3. Scroll down to the **Variants** section within the product details and find the option you want to add values to, such as ```Size```, ```Color```, or ```Material```.
