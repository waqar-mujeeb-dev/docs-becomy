description: Create collections to demonstrate your products into categories
---

Collections help organize products into categories, making it easier for customers to find what they are looking for. Collections can group similar items together, like **Summer Dresses** or **Electronics**. This improves the shopping experience, helps customers discover more products, and can increase sales.

Collections can be displayed on the product page to help users easily navigate and explore related products. When a product is part of a collection, the collection name is often displayed on the product page. Users can click on the collection name to view the collection's dedicated page, which showcases images and products within that collection. 
This allows customers to see all items grouped under the same category, making it easier to discover additional products they might be interested in. The design and layout of collection pages are determined by your theme.

To manage your collections, navigate to the **Collections** section in your Becomy admin. Here, you can view existing collections, create new ones, and make edits as needed.

## Types of Collections

You can create two types of collections: automated and manual. 

### Automated Collections

Automated collections use conditions to automatically include matching products. For example, you can set a condition to include all products tagged with "Summer" in a **Summer Collection**. This type of collection updates itself as you add new products that meet the conditions.

### Manual Collections

Manual collections require you to individually add each product. This gives you complete control over which products are included. For instance, you might create a **Featured Products** collection and handpick the items you want to showcase.

### Displaying Collections

Once created, collections can be displayed on your online store as a webpage with a gallery of the products. Customers can click on a product image to visit the specific product's page. To help customers find collections, you can add links to them in your store's navigation menu.

The exact layout and appearance of collection pages depend on your theme. 

You can view, create, and edit collections from the **Collections** page in your Becomy admin.
