# Manual Collections

A manual collection on Becomy allows you to create a specific set of products. These collections remain static unless you manually add or remove products. 
This guide will walk you through the steps to create, manage, and delete manual collections.
Manual collections are ideal for grouping products that you want to feature together. Unlike automatic collections, manual collections require you to select each product individually.

You cannot convert an automatic collection into a manual collection. If you need a manual collection, you must create it from scratch.
