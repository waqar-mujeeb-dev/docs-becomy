The Inventory Management feature within the Becomy project provides a comprehensive overview of the inventory levels for various products and their variants. It allows users to efficiently manage stock levels, track incoming inventory, and ensure smooth operations across different warehouses. This feature enhances operational efficiency, improves inventory accuracy, and ultimately contributes to a better customer experience.

Navigate to the `Becomy Admin Dashboard` and open the `Catalog` tab. Under this tab, select "`Inventory Levels`" to access the inventory management section.
