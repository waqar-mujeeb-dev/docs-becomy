# Processing Orders

When a customer purchases from your online store or any other sales channel, it appears as a new order on the Orders page in Becomy admin dashboard.

## What happens when you receive an online order

- You receive a new order notification by email.
- The Orders page in Becomy displays the new order.
- The customer receives an order confirmation email.
- Order processing begins.

:::info

An abandoned checkout is created if an order wasn't completed, but the customer reached the checkout.

## Typical processing flow for online orders

Every online order goes through 3 stages. At each stage, a different action is required in Becomy. You can either set up Becomy to perform these actions automatically or handle them manually:

<Table
  headers={["Order state", "What you need to do"]}
  rows={[
    ["1. Order has been placed.", "Capture payment."],
    ["2. Order has been paid.", "Fulfill the order."],
    ["3. Order has been fulfilled and paid.", "Archive the order."],
  ]}
/>
