# Processing Orders

When a customer purchases from your online store or any other sales channel, it appears as a new order on the Orders page in Becomy admin dashboard.

## What happens when you receive an online order

- You receive a new order notification by email.
- The Orders page in Becomy displays the new order.
- The customer receives an order confirmation email.
- Order processing begins.

:::info

An abandoned checkout is created if an order wasn't completed, but the customer reached the checkout.

## Typical processing flow for online orders

Every online order goes through 3 stages. At each stage, a different action is required in Becomy. You can either set up Becomy to perform these actions automatically or handle them manually:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Order state</th>
      <th>What you need to do</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1. Order has been placed.</td>
      <td>Capture payment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2. Order has been paid.</td>
      <td>Fulfill the order.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3. Order has been fulfilled and paid.</td>
      <td>Archive the order.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
