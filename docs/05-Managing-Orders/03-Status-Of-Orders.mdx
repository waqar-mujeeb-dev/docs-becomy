# Understanding Your Order Statuses

Orders have various statuses such as order status, payment status, fulfillment status, and return status. These statuses are used to create views that help you track order progress and identify orders that require action.

You can filter your orders using different combinations of order statuses.

## Order Status

Orders can either be **Open** or **Archived**, but may also have additional statuses. Archived orders that were canceled will show both **Canceled** and **Archived** statuses. Orders have one or more of the following statuses:

<Table
  headers={["Status", "Description"]}
  rows={[
    [
      "Open",
      "The order was placed or created. There is work to do, such as processing payment, fulfilling the order, or handling returns.",
    ],
    ["Archived", "The order was manually or automatically archived."],
    [
      "Canceled",
      "The order was canceled. If it wasn’t fully refunded, there might still be work remaining.",
    ],
  ]}
/>

## Payment Status

The payment status of an order is crucial in determining the tasks you need to complete. Orders can have one or more of the following payment statuses:

<Table
  headers={["Status", "Description"]}
  rows={[
    [
      "Pending",
      "Payment is pending because either the customer used a payment method that takes time to process, or you set the payment terms when creating the order. This status also applies to manual payment methods like Cash on Delivery.",
    ],
    [
      "Authorized",
      "The payment provider validated the payment information. This is displayed if you capture payments manually. You need to capture the payment before the authorization period expires.",
    ],
    [
      "Overdue",
      "Payment wasn’t captured before the due date set in the payment terms.",
    ],
    [
      "Expiring",
      "This isn’t a payment status, but an expiring badge appears two days before the deadline for capturing an **Authorized** payment.",
    ],
    [
      "Expired",
      "Payment wasn’t captured before the expiration set by the payment provider. For some providers, this indicates a failed payment.",
    ],
    [
      "Paid",
      "The payment was captured, either automatically or manually, or the order was marked as paid.",
    ],
    ["Refunded", "The full amount paid by the customer was refunded."],
    ["Partially refunded", "A portion of the total payment was refunded."],
    ["Partially paid", "A partial payment was captured for the order."],
    ["Voided", "The unpaid order was canceled."],
    [
      "Unpaid",
      "This status includes orders in Authorized, Pending**, Expired, and Partially paid statuses.",
    ],
  ]}
/>

## Fulfillment Status

An order can have one of the following fulfillment statuses:

- **Fulfilled**
- **Unfulfilled**
- **Partially fulfilled**
- **Scheduled**
- **On hold**

When an order is placed, it is **Unfulfilled** unless automatic payment capture and fulfillment of all items were enabled in your checkout settings.

If only some items have been shipped, the order status becomes **Partially fulfilled**. Once all items are shipped, it is **Fulfilled**.

Prepaid subscription orders show as **Scheduled** until the fulfillment date is reached, after which they become **Unfulfilled**.

If upsell offers were presented to the customer at checkout, the fulfillment status is temporarily set to **On hold**. You can reserve inventory but can't fulfill the order until the hold is released.

Manual fulfillment holds also show the **On hold** status.

## Return Status

Orders can have multiple returns, and this status indicates the most important return-related task. Orders without returns don’t have a return status. If an order has at least one return, it will have one of the following statuses:

<Table
  headers={["Status", "Description"]}
  rows={[
    [
      "Return requested",
      "A return was requested for items in the order. You can approve or decline the request.",
    ],
    [
      "Return in progress",
      "The return was approved or created in the Becomy admin. You can manage the return, restock items, or issue a refund.",
    ],
    ["Returned", "The return is complete, and no further action is required."],
    [
      "Inspection complete",
      "The items in the return were inspected, and you can refund the return based on the inspection results.",
    ],
  ]}
/>
