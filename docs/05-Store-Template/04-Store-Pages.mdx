# Store Pages

The **`Pages`** section in the **`Store Template`** tab provides users with the tools to manage and customize the pages of their Becomy store. Users can control the `visibility` of pages, `create` new ones, and `modify` various settings to tailor the store experience to their needs.

## Page Management

In this section, users have several options for managing their store pages:

- **Activate/Deactivate Pages**: Users can choose to `activate` or `deactivate` default pages in their store as needed.

- **Create New Pages**: Easily `add` new pages to the store with custom settings and content.

- **Preview Pages**: `Preview` any page before finalizing changes to ensure it looks as expected.

- **Edit Page Settings**: Easily `edit` page settings as needed.

- **Delete Pages**: `Remove` any page that is no longer needed.

## Page Settings

When creating or editing a page, users can adjust the following `settings`:

- **Title**: The name displayed for the page within the store.
  
- **Page Title**: The title that appears in the browser tab and is indexed by search engines.

- **Page Description**: A brief description of the page, often used for SEO purposes to help customers find the page through search engines.

- **Category**: Organize pages by assigning them to specific `categories` for better structure and navigation.

## Built-In Page Builder

Becomy offers a built-in `Drag and Drop Page Builder` tool that users can utilize to `build` and customize page `layouts` without needing `coding skills`. This feature makes it easy to create visually appealing and fully functional pages.
