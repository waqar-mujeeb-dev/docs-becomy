# Paying Bills on Becomy with a Credit Card

You can manage different types of bills directly through your Becomy admin, all of which can be paid using your `credit card`:

- **General bill payments**: For general Becomy bills, such as paying for your subscription, you can use a `credit card` as your payment method.

- **Shipping billing**: Shipping label charges and adjustments are billed to the `credit card` associated with your `Becomy account`. All shipping charges are billed in the applicable currency based on the shipping services used.

## Paying Your Becomy Bills

All your Becomy bills, including general payments and shipping charges, will be paid using your credit card. Be sure to review your billing information to ensure that your payments are processed smoothly.

## Managing Payment Methods

You can add and manage your payment methods through your Becomy dashboard:

1. Go to your **Becomy dashboard**.
2. On the sidebar, click on the **Settings** tab.
3. From the Settings dropdown, select **Billing Information**.
4. Here, you can add, update, or manage your `payment options`.

Be sure to keep your `billing information` up to date for smooth payment processing.
