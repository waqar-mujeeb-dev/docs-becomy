## Order Fulfillment and Shipping Setup Checklist

This checklist outlines the main steps to start shipping products from your **`Becomy` store**. You might find it helpful to print this checklist or download it as a PDF for reference throughout the setup process.

To start shipping, complete the following tasks:

- **Set up your shipping rates and methods**
- **Add product weights**
- **Add HS codes to your products**
- **Choose your preferred package types**
- **Get free packaging**
- **Print a test shipping label**
- **Resolve issues with location assignment**

### Set Up Your Shipping Rates and Methods

When deciding what to charge customers for shipping, consider the following options:

- **Exact shipping costs**: Charge customers the same rates that carriers, such as **`USPS`** or **`Canada Post`**, charge to ship.
- **Flat rate shipping**: Set fixed shipping rates based on order value or weight. For example, charge **`$5`** to ship anywhere in the United States.
- **Free shipping**: Offer free shipping on all orders or set rules, such as free shipping for orders over **`$150`**.

Unexpected costs at the checkout are one of the main reasons why customers abandon purchases. The most common unexpected costs are related to shipping. Make your shipping costs clear on your **`home page`** or **`product page`** to avoid surprises at checkout.

---

### Add Product Weights

Shipping costs are calculated based on the weight and dimensions of your shipment.

To calculate accurate shipping costs, add weights to all of the products that you will be shipping. If youâ€™re unsure how much your products weigh, then learn about common product weights or order a scale.

**Add product weights**

---

### Add HS Codes to Your Products

As of March 1, 2023, it's mandatory for all shipments transported by air destined to, or transiting through the **`European Union`**, **`Northern Ireland`**, **`Norway`**, and **`Switzerland`** to have a **6-digit Harmonized System (HS) code** and detailed goods description for each item in the order.

The **`World Customs Organization`** offers resources to learn more about the system, and you can find your product's HS code in the **`HTS (Harmonized Tariff Schedule)`** search.

**Add HS codes to your products**

---

### Choose Your Preferred Package Types

Save your preferred package types on the shipping settings page of your **`Becomy admin`**. You can select envelopes, boxes, or carrier-specific packaging, such as **`USPS Flat Rate`** packaging.

**Choose your preferred package types**

---

### Get Free Packaging Materials

Many carriers offer free packaging to use with specific shipping services. Although there is no cost for the packaging, you might need to create a free account with the carrier so that they can send the packaging to you. The following **`Becomy Shipping`** carriers offer free packaging:

- **USPS**
- **UPS**
- **DHL Express**

**Get free packaging**

### Print a Test Shipping Label

If a customer pays for shipping, whether for the exact cost or flat rate, then you will receive the payment along with the rest of the funds for their order. When you print shipping labels through **`Becomy`**, you will be charged the cost of the label on your **`Becomy`** bill.

When you receive an order, you can buy and print **`USPS`**, **`UPS`**, **`DHL Express`**, and **`Canada Post`** shipping labels from **`Becomy`** to ship your order. Depending on your **`Becomy subscription plan`**, you will save up to 60% on shipping as compared to retail rates.

Labels can be printed using a standard desktop printer or with a supported thermal label printer.

**Print a test shipping label**

### Resolve Issues with Location Assignment

If a checkout failure alert displays because a product could not be shipped to a customer's address, then take the following steps to test your shipping rates and to correct the issue.
